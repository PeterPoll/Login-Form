#Login-Form ReactJs and MongoDB

This is a login form page.

Using ReactJs, Mongodb, Nodejs, Axios, Express and many others libraries.

You can give your credentials and the nodejs checks on mongodb.  If the credentials are successful then you go to the second page and keep the credentials on browser cookies so to be able to move to another page.

At the second page you can click the button Logout and go to the Sign in page and of course remove the credentials from cookies.
